\section{Termination Criteria}
As is customary for most genetic programming approaches, certain termination criteria are necessary to ensure a finite amount of time before a solution is produced. For this assignment we include a maximum number of generations to be run as well as a problem-specific success predicate as the termination criteria.

The success predicate entails an individual predicting the discharge decisions for all patients in the training set correctly. The maximum number of generations allowed was chosen as 256. Notably, in the tests that were run the success predicate was never attained.
